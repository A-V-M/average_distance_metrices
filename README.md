# average_distance_metrices
DISTATIS is a technique developed by Abdi and colleagues specifically to combine different DMs (distance matrices) on the same space for visualisation purposes (Abdi et al, 2009). It works by first extracting a cross-product matrix for each DM (thus making the method insensitive to the metric used for computing each DM), subsequently computing all possible pair-wise distances between them (typically cosine metric), and then finally analysing this square matrix of inter-DM distances through principal component analysis (PCA). The resulting first eigenvector to come out from this indicates how similar one particular DM is to all other DMs. Outlier DMs with small values or projections on this eigenvector would accordingly have small weights when computing the average cross-product matrix. For standard DISTATIS, this is essentially the culmination of the process since it is this weighted-average cross product matrix that is used further for visualisation and so technically no compromise DM is actually computed. For this reason I had to add a further step using the following equation to extract the necessary compromise DM from the resultant cross-product matrix.
